<h1 style="color:white;">Frequently asked questions</h1>

<h2 style="color:white;">As more questions get asked I will add them here.</h2>

<p style="color:white;">Question: Can you add /home to the server?</p>
<p style="color:white;">Answer: I will not be adding /home to the server because I want to try and keep the server as
  vinilla as possible. So, I believe having to remember where your house is could be part of that. We also have an
  online map.</p>
<p style="color:white;">Question: Is keep inventory on?</p>
<p style="color:white;">Answer: Not in the overworld or in the nether but in The End I do have keep inventory on.</p>
<p style="color:white;">Question: Can you tp me?</p>
<p style="color:white;">Answer: No. I do try not to use my power as Admin to teleport people unless it's part of
  something I am doing with a spcific person.</p>
<p style="color:white;">Question: How do I acsess the skills menu?</p>
<p style="color:white;">Answer: You can acsess the skills menu with the command /skill. </p>
<p style="color:white;">Question: Will the server have any paied cosmetics or items?</p>
<p style="color:white;">Answer: No. I do like pay to win or having to pay for cosmetics. If it ever happens it would
  have a fairly easy method to get those cosmetics through normal gameplay. I hate having exclusive content in my server
  that people can't earn through normal means, However this does extend to the early acsess donation option because
  they're more like beta testers or alpha testers just there to help.</p>
<p style="color:white;">Question: Can you give me blank?</p>
<p style="color:white;">Answer: I will no longer be giving items with commands to players because I realized it is very
  unfair and I believe that you need to work for it but this also does apply to me in most cases.</p>
