<h1 style="color:white;">Meme SMP Season Two/Meme SMP ReForged!</h1>
<p style="color:white;">Meme SMP Season Two or ReForged is a amazing season of Meme SMP because after the flop which
  was Meme SMP Season One I took a long break. Which lasted one year. Once I came back I tried to revitalize Meme SMP by
  not doing to much while keeping people intrested by doing new things as well. Some of these things is not be cocky
  with the server resources. In Season One I was a bit to cocky with the resources the server had, In which I mean the
  little it had. Meme SMP Season One ran off of a twelve-ish year old laptop with a Intel Celoron (CPU) with four
  gigibytes of DDR3 Ram. Which if you didn't know running a server off of these resources takes a lot of time and
  patience to get working smothly without any major issues. Season Two lasted a good while with a good amount of player
  activity but in The End there was not a whole lot of new this season but that will change next season.</p>
