<h1 style="color:white;">Meme SMP Season One</h1>

<p style="color:white;">Meme SMP Season One was a weird season. Meme SMP Season One had a lot to live upto because of
  Meme SMP Season Zero. People had a lot of fun in Season Zero so when I started work on Season One I knew I had to keep
  the hype going so I did a few diffrent things. I self-hosted this season, Meaning I hosted the Server on my own PC. I
  also spent months going through and finding plugins that would make the server better. I started the server on August
  4, 2021 (It was delayed by about five days initally). It was subsequently shutdown on September 10th, 2021. This
  season has even less known about it then zero so I do apologize if there is some missing infromation.
  (This Will be updated as I do find more for Meme SMP Season One)</p>

  <p style="color:white;">In terms of screenshots there is not a lot remaining of Season One it was not Meme SMP's most
    popular season. But there is some video footage. (I should mention I do not believe all of the footage is from the
    same season but I do not remember well enough to know for sure)</p>
