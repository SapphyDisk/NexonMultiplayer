    <p style="color:white;">Hello and welcome to Nexon! Nexon is a server I (Amethyst) began running in the spring of 2023. The reason I started running Nexon is because I wanted to have a safe space for me and my friends to hang out because when you see four or five of your friends online at once it's a magical feeling, However more recentaly I wanted to expand passed just friends and onto more players. So with a rule change and some server upgrades I feel like I am ready to host a bigger server.</p>
