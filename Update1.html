<h1 style="color:white;">Server Updates July 1st, 2023</h1>
<p style="color:white;">Hello everyone! I have made some exiting updates to the server! So to start I added a skills
  plugin! This plugin will allow you to get more powerful with many diffrent types of skills. Using the /skill command
  you can check and see your skills and compare with people on a leaderboard. I like this plugin it gives you all more
  to do on the server while also continuing to have fun! I also changed the tab plugin. I changed it to the Tablist
  plugin by jmp. The reason for this change is so I do not have to configure the other plugin to show what I want. I
  just wanted the plugin to show the TPS (Ticks per Second) and memory usage. I didn't get both but I can assure the
  server is running fine because of the TPS.</p>
