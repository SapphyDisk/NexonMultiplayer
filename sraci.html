<p style="color:white;">Server resources. This page is for people looking to help the server in a couple of diffrent
  ways.</p>

<h2 style="color:white;">Computer Specs</h2>

<h2 style="color:white;">Other and needed resources</h2>
<p style="color:white;">Nexon is currently only run by one person. This is cool and all but the server could use some
  help. So, I will at some point add a moderator application form, However that is not the only thing the server needs.
  I need programers to help me make plugins for the server.</p>
