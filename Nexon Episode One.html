<h2 style="color:white;">Some starting infromation</h2>
<p style="color:white;">Now before you scroll on you should know some stuff about Nexon and the person who runs it.</p
  <br>
<p style="color:white;">Hello I am Amethyst and I made Nexon for me and my friends to play. Nexon was started initially
  as Meme SMP Season Five but over time I became less of a fan of that Idea. There were a number of reasons but the one
  it came down to the most is I wanted to retire the name and try again with a new coat of paint. I did not want to just
  run another Meme SMP, I wanted to make a server that would go longer and have it's own creative direction. That is why
  instead of changing seasons every three months or so I change the episode in that duration and a season is a group of
  episodes. This lets me make a general idea that can carry out for as long or as little as I want. I also can give
  player more freedom with a better a more fleshed out server that is not running on twelve year old hardware. The last
  thing I would like to mention here is Nexon was not started in a hurry unlike Meme SMP where a season could start
  within a day of me mentioning it. Nexon I have spent a lot of time thinking of the next episode and what could be the
  most fun and acessible.
